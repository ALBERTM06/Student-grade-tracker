# Student Grade Tracker

The **Student Grade Tracker** is a simple Python program that allows users to record, manage, and analyse student grades.

## Features
- âž• Add students and their grades  
- ðŸ“‚ Store data temporarily in memory  
- ðŸ“Š Calculate average grade  
- ðŸ“ˆ Display student performance (average, highest, and lowest grades)  

---

## Example Output
--- Student Performance ---
Name: Alice
Subjects and Grades:
Math: 85
Physics: 90
Chemistry: 78
Average Grade: 84.33
Highest Grade: 90
Lowest Grade: 78

## What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced and strengthened the following Python concepts:
- âœ… Working with **dictionaries** to store structured data (student info + subjects/grades).  
- âœ… Using **loops** to collect user input dynamically.  
- âœ… Performing **basic calculations** (average, min, max).  
- âœ… Improving code readability with **string methods** like `.strip()` and `.title()`.  
- âœ… Printing clean, formatted output for a better user experience.  
- âœ… Git and GitHub basics â€” adding, committing, and pushing code to a repository.

## Next Steps (Future Improvements)
- Allow adding **multiple students** and viewing all records at once.  
- Save and load student data from a file (CSV/JSON) for persistence.  
- Add grade validation (e.g., between 0â€“100 only).  
- Build a simple GUI version using Tkinter or a web version with Flask/Django.
